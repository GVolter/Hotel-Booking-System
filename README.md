# Hotel-Booking-System
THe project imitates the behaviour of a hotel booking system. There is an admin that keeps track of all the customers, hotels and of all the elements in the system. Hotel managers can use the system to add their hotel and rooms so they can be reserved by customers that can book one or more rooms.
